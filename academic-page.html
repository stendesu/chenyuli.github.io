							<h3>Tempo Runner </h3>
							<p>• Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprints)</p>
							<p>A first-person, fast paced movement close combat fighter. My final project that I made during college as an attempt to replicate the highlight mechanics of Ghostrunner. The Korean theme is referenced through real time pictures of korea streets during the school trip. This game is fully packaged with functional graphics settings system for players who prefer to play with outstanding Unreal Engine graphics. All 2D assets are self-made and free to use online 3D assets. The sword animations are swift but fluid, made using Timeline nodes.</p>
							<p>The game contains a tutorial stage and a main stage built for the player to wall run, dash and double jump onto.</p>

								<h3>Wandering Witch </h3>
								<p>• Unreal Engine 4 (Blueprints)</p>
								<p>My most proud project made during College. It is a complete package of a game with replay-ability, simple controls, visually understandable concepts. Compatible Arcade controls in gameplay and menu.</p>
								<p>A Touhou inspired gameplay that includes basic enemies that shoots down at the player and will spawn multiple bosses around every 30 seconds or so.</p>
								<p>Every single asset is made by me, using Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint.</p>
								<p></p>

								<h3>3D Tank Game </h3>
								<p>• Unreal Engine 5.2 (Blueprints)</p>
								<p>The first game I made during University, it is packaged as a complete game with stages, various enemy types that combats the player in long and short range, at the very end the player fights a boss that has 10 phases, each phase spawns enemies that the player has encountered throughout the level, and 50% causes the boss to attack more aggressively.</p>
								<p>Various weapons for the player to equip with using an equipment table.</p>

									<h3>Battle Monkey</h3>
									<p>• Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprints)</p>
									<p>Battle Monkey was a 4-man Team project made during College, I contributed 70% of the game, including majority of the gameplay, enemies, UI system, stages, and mechanics.</p>
									<p>This was my take on trying to create a similar game titled Battle Cats. Player sends out monkeys to destroy the enemy's base on the otherside, whilst the enemy will do the same, sending out multiple different animals to defend against the player's monkeys.</p>
									<p>All UI assets are made by me.</p>
									<p>Monkey, enemy and any other sprites are made by teammates.</p>

									<h3>Robo Escape</h3>
									<p>• Unreal Engine 4 (Blueprints)</p>
									<p>This game was my College Year 1 Final project, inspired by a Facebook game Titled Dungeon Rampage. This game features a Top down combat system where the player has 3 weapons, each weapon has their own use depending on the situation of the player. A working level up and weapon upgrade system using widgets.</p>
									<p>Enemies are made to have two states, idle state and aggro state, similar to wow, players are able to aggro enemies and use this strategy to kill enemies one by one. There are 3 levels compiled with puzzles to enter the next level, everytime the player enters the next level, it'll buff the enemies by scaling their stats.</p>
									<p>All assets are made by Me using Clip Studio and Photoshop</p>

									<h3>First Side Scroller Project</h3>
									<p>• Unreal Engine 4 (Blueprints)</p>
									<p>This side scroller game is my Very First game project made during college, this was a simple side scroller game where the players must defeat enemies using a single dash mechanic, the player is able to dash horizontally depending on which direction the player is facing and vertically, each dash will do damage to the enemies. A separate boss level was created with fully functional simple melee AI mechanics. Each stage was made with mechanics in thought, with traps and difficult jumps.</p>
									<p>All assets are made by Me using Clip Studio and Photoshop</p>
